Coding concepts that I learn everyday

# 08/24/20 Tuesday
Today I learned about the the built in array object method "include?"
With this method you can search through an array for an object.
The method will return true if found and false if not.

``
array = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]
array.include?("two")

Output => true
``
